This is a Telegram bot which helps to learn Spanish words.

The logic:
1) the bot provides a word in Spanish which a user has to translate, sending a response message;
2) if the user's response is correct he/she receives a message with congrtulation and a new word, otherwice he/she receives a message with a correct answer.

Steps for further development:
a) to add database with Esp-Rus words;
b) to add option of reversal translation (Rus-Esp);
c) to split words by random butches of 10 items, the user has to gain 10 points translating these words; the words which were not translated will be provided 
to the user again;
d) to add levels of difficulty.
